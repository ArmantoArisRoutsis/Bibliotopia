## About

###### This is my Version of the classic To-Do-List. I made this web application using Node.js & Express.js for the backend. For the database I used MongoDB. As for the front end just basic HTML5 & CSS3 was used along with EJS templating. The application gives you the option to add and remove items from a default-list. Aside from that the user is also given the ability to create multiple other lists.

## Technologies Used

## Technical Information

### To run the site on your local machine

If you wish to run this locally you will to first need clone this repository to your local machine. Afterwards you will have to run npm install inside both the client and server folders for all the necessary dependencies to be installed. For the backend you will have to run the command npm start inside the server folder. The server will run on “http://localhost:5000/”. As for the Frontend you will need to run the command npm start inside the client folder. After that when all the configurations are done a new window should open automatically on your browser displaying the client side of the app which runs on “http://localhost:3000/”.
